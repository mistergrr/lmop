Cult of the Dragon members have a hard time passing as normal citizens. They hold an unabashedly apocalyptic view of the future, one in which undead dragons rule the world. The cultists are fanatically devoted to bringing that vision to life.

As such, they typically avoid civilization. They prefer to serve dragons, offering the creatures gifts
and information and encouraging them to become dracoliches. This was the mission of the Neverwinter cell until Valindra captured its leader, Adimond Kroskas, and took his [[Ring of Dragons]].
