Thundertree was once a community that prospered on the edges of the Neverwinter Woods.

During the founding of the village, Thundertree was defended from monsters by the hero Palien of Neverwinter, who would be honored with a statue in the town square.

The village was the hometown of young Aribeth de Tylmarande who would later gain fame and infamy. At some point in her childhood, she managed to save Thundertree from a power-hungry wizard of Luskanm using her enchanted ring of the wood elves â€“ a gift from Ansal Bloodshoulder. At some point later, the village came under attack by an orc raiding party, killing most of the inhabitants at the time, with Aribeth de Tylmarande surviving the massacre.

However, when Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR, it devastated the small town. In the wake of the disaster, ash zombies drove off any who survived the eruption. During this time, Thundertree lay in overgrown ruins, with many of its stone houses lacking roofs and lying open to the elements, though some remained mostly intact. It was disturbingly quiet.

In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, the Ashmadai leader Favria set up camp in the ruins of Thundertree, living within a ruined inn's underground wine cellar. From there, she tracked activity in both Neverwinter and everywhere the Thayans employed their cult.

By 1491 DR, the zombies had crumbled to dust, but strange magic had turned the local flora into twig blights.
