This village is located northeast of Leilon, where the road that runs from the High Road to Triboar fades away into a mere trail. The road was largely abandoned long ago after orc attacks from the mountains east of Leilon. The orcs even paid human mages to work magic powerful enough to bury the road in some places and hurl down small keeps in others.

Under the leadership of a chieftain called Uruth, the orcs expanded their holdings steadily, building a realm they called Uruth Ukrypt (roughly, Home of Uruth). Its name is echoed today in the Kryptgarden Forest.

Too lazy or stupid to support themselves by farming, the orcs soon decimated the huntable game in their realm. They subsequently took to raiding human holdings for food. Some 400 years have passed since then, during which time concerted human attacks on the orcs ended their kingdom and almost drove them from the area entirely.

Phandalin had been an important farming center before the orcs conquered it. When they were driven out, the village was left largely in ruins, and it remains so today.

No one lives there now but monsters, though passing hunters and rangers often camp in one of the more secure buildings. It has three deep wells that can still be used.

The orc attacks also forced gnomes and dwarves to abandon a mountain delve near Phandalin where they were mining mithral together. This lost lode was called Wavecho Cave because the roll and boom of waves beating on the Sword Coast shore could be heard in the natural cavern.

Some dwarves of the North dream of returning there, and the gnomes who dwell near Waterdeep consider it their rightful home. Both races constantly search the mountains and the subterranean passages for a way back into Wavecho Cave. Rich stores of mithral and magical items of gnomish and dwarven make were enchanted in Wavecho by human mages allied with the other races. These enchanted items are said to still lie in the caves and delvings. (Note that this is not the same place as the monsterinfested dwarfhold called Southkrypt.)

The orcs attacked Wavecho in force, and in the spell battle between the defending mages and the wizards hired by the orcs, the land was changed, the ceilings of many caverns and chambers collapsed, and the very location of Wavecho was lost.

The countryside near and in Phandalin is now best suited to adventurers and those who like to hunt monsters for sport. There have always been rumors of rich treasure lost in the fighting in the area that is just waiting for a lucky or persistent venturer to find it.
