# History
"Once a small but elegant estate, the ruined estate sits upon a hill overlooking [[Phandalin Town|Phandalin]]. Tresendar Manor was once the home of the royal Tresendar family in Phandalin. Notably amongst the family was [[Aldith Tresendar]], a great knight also known as "Black Hawk" The family lived there until the an orc horde razed it to the ground in 951DR. In the intervening years, the manor had become an empty shell of its former splendour with only the cellars and crypts remaining in good condition.

Most of the members of the Tresendar family were buried in the crypt below the manor. Sometime before 1491 DR, some members of the family had risen as undead defending the cellars of the manor.

It stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor had long been abandoned, but sometime in 1491 DR, its cellars had been converted into a stronghold for the [[Redbrands]].

While the Manor has never been fully rebuilt since it was razed, history seems intent on keeping it in rubble.
