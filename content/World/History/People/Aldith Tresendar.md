Aldith Tresendar, also known as the "Black Hawk", was a member of the Tresendar family.
Aldith was a great knight who died fighting the orcs that rampaged on the town of Phandalin in 951 DR. The orcs found the hidden caverns underneath [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor]], where Aldith fought them.

Aldith carried with him a magical blade in a silver-chased scabbard that was inscribed with the name "[[Talon]]". The hilt of the blade was shaped into a majestic bird with its wings stretched out wide. Talon was lost in the caverns under the manor until a nothic found the blade.
