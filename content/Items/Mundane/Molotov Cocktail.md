As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. The fire spreads in a 10ft radius. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the Molotov as an improvised weapon. On a direct hit, the target takes 1d6 fire damage. Any creatures within the fire's radius takes an additional 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
