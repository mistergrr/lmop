Ziggywix,

I loved you. Once.

At least, I think I did.

I remember being enraptured by your soothing voice, those confident hands, and that MASSIVE... SMILE.

But now all I see is a thick, inky darkness that clouds your soul. Gone is the gentle caring gnome I once knew, replaced by a rough and unhappy brute.

At first, I thought your interests curious. Exciting, even. But I just found your... hobby room, and I finally see the depth of your perversion.

You're not well and it scares me. You scare me. I don't feel safe raising our son around you.

I'm taking Alto and leaving.

Don't try to find us.

M
