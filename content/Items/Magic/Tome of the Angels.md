# Description.
Ancient and illustrious grimoire, bound in the pure hide of a long-extinct unicorn and secured with silver clasps etched with celestial runes. Its pages, brittle with age and stained with age, are inscribed with incantations and celestial knowledge penned by the hands of forgotten wizards and fallen priests. The book emanates a palpable aura of warmth, whispering secrets to those who open it. Legends speak of the tome's origin in the highest levels of heaven, said to contain the power to summon souls that have travelled to the higher planes.

Possession of the Tome promises immense power, but can only be contained by the righteous and incorruptible. Those with even a hint of darkness

# History
It was crafted by the infamous necromancer Thalazar the Cursed, who sought to control the powers of the underworld. Thalazar, in his pursuit of ultimate power, made a pact with the Demon Prince Azazel, trading his soul for the knowledge to bind and command the damned. The necromancer spent decades inscribing the tome with spells and rituals derived from the darkest corners of the nether realms, using the blood of sacrificial victims to seal each incantation.

The tome passed through the hands of various dark sorcerers and warlocks over the centuries, each adding their own forbidden knowledge and enhancing its malevolent power.
# Current location
The Tome of the Damned is now hidden within the Abyssal Library, a secret and treacherous location buried deep beneath the ruins of an ancient city. The library is protected by a series of magical wards and traps designed to keep out all but the most determined and powerful seekers. Guarded by spectral librarians who were once the keepers of forbidden knowledge, the tome lies on a pedestal in the center of a chamber surrounded by a circle of containment runes. The air is thick with the whispers of the damned, and a palpable sense of dread pervades the place. Few who enter the Abyssal Library in search of the Tome of the Damned ever return, and those who do are often driven mad by the horrors they have witnessed.
