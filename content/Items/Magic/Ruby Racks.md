# Description.
A seemingly ordinary bag filled with enchanted snacks. Once per day, eating one of these snacks restores 1d4 hit points, or grants 1d4 temporary hit points for 1 hour. If more than one snack is consumed in a day, the eater must make a DC 12 CON saving throw or be charmed for 1 hour, thinking that everyone around them is a monster (hallucinations ensue).

The bag never seems to empty.
