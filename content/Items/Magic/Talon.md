The sword once belonged to [[Aldith Tresendar]] , also known as the "Black Hawk." Aldith was a great knight who died fighting the orcs that rampaged on the town of Phandalin in 951 DR. The orcs found the hidden caverns underneath [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor]], where Aldith fought them.
