**Age**: 40

**Description**: 
Takes the guise of an attractive human.

Although Rohini does not sit in overt leadership in the cathedral; the acolytes, servants, and patients bow to her, calling her simply "Prophet." She seems to her followers to be a kindly matron of forty years of age, graceful and overwhelmingly compassionate. Through subtle charm, Rohini has captured the hearts and minds of the people- sometimes literally.

The Prophet worships no particular god, but [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] and the other acolytes believe that several of her auguries foretell the return of [[Helm]], god of guardians. Rohini is accorded a position of comfort, respect, and awe at the cathedral. It also doesn't hurt that she has enthralled several members of the clergy with her succubus powers.

For more about the Prophet and her schemes, see Neverwinter Campaign Setting page 96.

**Quests**:
At some point, Rohini might try to steer the characters through reward or charm. She is adept at manipulation and always knows the right thing to say. If one of the characters has a spell scar, the Prophet might claim that she can cure the malady in exchange for a service. Even if the adventurers discover her true nature, she might present herself as an ally rather than an enemy — at least for the time being.

Perhaps Rohini is legitimately on their side, thinking that the characters can free her of the aboleths' influence, or maybe she is setting them up for a fall. Ultimately, she is a devil, and trust and compassion are foreign to her nature. If she does not betray the adventurers immediately, she will try to get rid of them as soon as she wrings every drop of usefulness from them.
