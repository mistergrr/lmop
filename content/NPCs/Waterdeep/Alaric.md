**Age**: 54 years old.
**Lifespan**: 60 years
**Voice**: "Bumblebee" and Michael Caine.
**Description**: 
Alaric’s feathers are white, which was a reason why the Duke & Duchess adopted him (as they thought it was a sign or a good omen) into the family. 
**Speech in Pantomime**. Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences.

Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents.

**Background**:
- Retired, homeless soldier who lived a nomadic lifestyle. Raised [[Richtor Helmsley III]] to pay off debts to the Helmsleys for rescuing him.
- Him letting Richtor go was like a bird leaving the nest, Richtor couldn’t be in that house forever, he had to go make the name Helmsley great somewhere else. ***7 years ago***.
- Left on a sour note (not to disregard what they’ve gone through or the years they spent together).

**Today**
- Living out the final years of his life running a <something] in [[Waterdeep]].
- Employs former soldiers, saving them from being homeless. Many are injured.
- 

**Quests**:
I’d love a reunion moment between him and Richtor, which would then lead into something that could help us transition as an adventurers group into our next adventure while still making sure Phandalin is in good hands if you feel me? Brad thinks Alaric might have forged the titles.

- Sends [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] on a quest, seemingly for himself, but it's actually for Richtor to gain closure.
