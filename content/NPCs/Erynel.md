# Erynel's Poems
**What's in a Name?**
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet.
So Son of Galdor would, were he not Galdor called.

Without that title. Love, doff thy name;
And for thy name, which is no part thee,
Take all myself.

E — The Forlorn

**Cursed Blessings**
My only love, sprung from my only hate!
Though blessed by the moon, yet cursed by fate!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy.

E — The Enraged

**Love Springs Forth**
O, to meet once more! Where the crickets hum soft.
Cradled in your arms, my soul and dreams held aloft.
The winter winds through which King's eyes blow
Are insufficient still, to chill my love's raging flow.

E — The Unshakeable

**My Love's Eternal**
Coiled like the roots 'neath the Old Great Oak
We lay entwined, speaking with words unspoke.
Your eyes shone bright, singing songs so clear,
"My love's eternal. There's naught to fear."

Alas! The latter rang untrue.
For out of the shadows stepped a king so cruel.
"Off with thy head! Let me end my chagrin.
Finally! I am rid of the last Celadrin."

Sold like stale bread; half a pence per pound.
To what new lands, new masters I am found?
Like the stars above, my love's eternal.
I pray thee not forget, yours forever, your Erynel.

E — The Despondent
