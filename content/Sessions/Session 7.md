## Quest
![[Quests#^town-wedding]]

[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] cleans the blood from town square with "Prestidigitation."

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Grrurika]] go hunting in the small patch of trees near [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor|Tresendar Manor]]. They find: 4 cups of red berries; 4 white mushrooms; 4 blue eggs; 2 brown eggs. They fail to catch rabbits. **There is no big game in this area.**

[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] and [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] pick flowers in the same area. They find: white flowers, blue flowers, and green foliage.

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] finds 10 kegs of ale in [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor|Tresendar Manor]]. He hauls one over to Town Hall and enlists [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] to help with more. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] is about to bury the Redbrand bodies. Richtor brings them to the crevasse and dumps them in view of [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]]. **-1 Town #rep**

It'll take too long to carry them one by one so [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] borrows a wagon from [[Elmar Barthen|Barthen]], who loans it for free since it's for the wedding. 9 kegs donated to wedding.

[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] and [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] plan a DJ set as the gang regroups in town square. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] has heard of a hunting area an hour north of town. He leads everyone there. They find animal tracks that diverge. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] follow one set, the rest follow the other.

**Eldon and Dorian**
They follow the tracks until they sense animals nearby. Snuffling sounds are heard. [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] casts "Sleep" in the direction of the sounds and hears a thud. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] steps out from the bushes and starts firing. He catches a group of [[boar|boars]] by surprise, killing one and wounding another with his phantom skill. He fires another shot, but misses.

The injured [[boar]] charges Eldon and knocks him prone. [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] steps out and "Magic Missiles" it.

**Grrurika, Richtor, and Thia**
They follow the tracks until they come across a clearing. The clearing is fille with ten elks, and a [[Giant Elk]]. The [[Giant Elk]] stand 15ft tall. It has beautiful white fur and massive antlers. The party fails their stealth check, alerting the elk. The elk flee, except for the [[Giant Elk]], who stands tall in between the party and the elk, acting as a defensive shield.

[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] casts "Sleep," but the [[Giant Elk]] shrugs it off. [[Grrurika]] casts "Bless" on the party.

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] throws a javelin, sticking the [[Giant Elk]]. He "Surges" to ready up. The elk lowers its head and charges, but misses [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]], who gets a free hit in. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] steps to [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor's]] side, draws her sword, and slashes the elk's side. [[Grrurika]] steps to the other side of [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and swings, but misses.

The [[Giant Elk]] turns its head, hitting [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] hard. 

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] swings hard with his hammer, cracking the [[Giant Elk]]'s antler.

Bloodied and with a broken antler, the [[Giant Elk]] tries to disengage an run away. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] uses "Dancing Lights" to startle the elk. [[Grrurika]] stretches her hand and casts "Guiding Bolt," killing the injured elk.

**Heading back**
[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] regroup with their four boars and help everyone load the kill onto the wagon that [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] brought.

As they reach [[Phandalin Town]], the sun has long set and dark clouds gather overhead. [[Sister Garaele]] sees them with the carcass of the [[Giant Elk]] and exclaims, "What have you done?" She informs them of the beliefs about Giant Elk and how killing one is a terrible omen. She urges them to take it away, especially with the wedding coming the next day.

The party deposit the boars off at the town hall and wheel the [[Giant Elk]] carcass to the riverbank northeast of the town.

After discussions about burning the body in a bonfire, they decide instead to cut the body up and bury the pieces. Its blood flows into the river.

[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] tries to sense if it was a deity and is pretty sure they just killed [[Bhaal]], the god of murder. [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] is pretty sure it's [[Lathander]], the god of birth and renewal.

**The whole party is cursed for defiling the mortal body of Lathander**

# Curses
[[Dorian of Galdor]]:
**Curse of Unstable Magic**: The death of the God of Rebirth has disrupted the natural flow of magic. Whenever they cast a spell, there’s a 25% chance the spell will have a random, chaotic effect instead of its intended outcome. **Use the wild magic table**

[[Eldon Tosscobble]]
**Curse of Lost Shadows**: The rogue’s connection to the ethereal is severed. They lose the ability to fully merge with shadows, making their Stealth checks automatically fail once per day at a critical moment.

[[Grrurika]]
**Curse of the Dead Hand**: The cleric’s connection to life-giving energy is corrupted. When they use any ability or spell that involves laying hands on an ally, there’s a chance that instead of healing, they siphon vitality from the target, dealing necrotic damage equal to half the intended healing amount. The damage taken by the target is then transferred to the cleric as temporary hit points, creating a twisted cycle of life and death.

[[Richtor Helmsley III]]
**Curse of Diminished Strength**: The loss of the God of Rebirth weakens the Battle Master's physical prowess. Each time they deal damage in combat, there's a 50% chance their strength temporarily diminishes, reducing their damage output by 1d4 for the next attack. This effect stacks, and only a long rest can reset their strength.

[[Thia Galanodel]]
**Curse of Forgotten Knowledge**: The wizards begin to forget key spells and lore they once knew. Each day, they lose access to one random spell they have prepared. The lost spell cannot be prepared again for 24 hours, leaving gaps in their magical repertoire.

[[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] speaks to [[Toblen Stonehill]] and finds out that [[Erynel]] was seen in town a while ago, in the  company of [[Iarno Albrek|Glasstaff]]. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor's]] [[Wolf Head Cloak]] is ready for pickup tomorrow.

The party heads to bed early. #rest
