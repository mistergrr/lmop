## Previously
![[Session 3#^Summary]]
## Day 4
[[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] and [[Korah]] arrive back from their adventure. [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric's]] gun is now [[Eldritch Gun]]. The party regroups at the inn and shares the info they gathered. They return to [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] for their reward.

[[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] encourages them to find out what happened to [[Iarno Albrek|Iarno Albrek]] — [[Quests#^find-iarno]].

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Grrurika]] return to the inn to look for potential recruits. They meet an old gnome eating soup, [[Ziggywix Tinkerton]]. They induct him into the party.

The rest go to [[Lionshield Coster]] to buy supplies.

On leaving, three [[Redbrands]] pick a fight.

**Combat**
> [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] casts "Sleep," but the only one affected is [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] and nearby civilians. She retreats into [[Lionshield Coster]]. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] wakes [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] and stands as group shield.

> [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] "Commands" a [[Redbrands|Redbrand]] to "swing" his weapon, hitting an ally. The Redbrands take turns swinging at [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]], but can't break his defence.

> [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] makes a ruffian soil himself and [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] blasts him away. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] kills another. The last ruffian flees. The two dead ruffians are looted for their cloaks, which are donned by [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] and [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]].

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]], [[Grrurika]], and [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] arrive. [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggy]] pisses on the dead ruffians and carves "Scum" onto their bodies. His dick is huge.

The party strings up the dead [[Redbrands]] in the town square. **-1 Town #rep**

They buy leather armour for [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggy]] while [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] commissions a [[Wolf Head Cloak]] from [[Finnegan Greenbottle]] — 2 days to complete.

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] leads the party under [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor]] via the "Tunnel of Love." He bumps into the Nothic in the cave. The Nothic refers to itself as "[[This One]]" and provides information in exchange for meat, which it dumps into the crevasse.
- Redbrands use tunnel to smuggle goods and people.

# Summary
