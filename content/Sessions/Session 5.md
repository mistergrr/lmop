# Redbrand Hideout pt.ii
## Previously
![[Session 4#^Summary]]
## Day 4
Party starts by going to the wizard's workshop. [[Iarno Albrek]]'s rat familiar warns him and he flees through his secret door.

[[Grrurika]] picks up [[Urmon's Tome]]. The rest of the loot is ingredients for 3 "Potions of Invisibility." In [[Iarno Albrek]]'s quarters, they find a letter to [[Iarno Albrek|Iarno]] from [[The Black Spider]].

***They don't connect that Iarno is Glasstaff.***

Find armoury and loot it for crossbows, bolts, cloaks, and a spear. They don the cloaks and the skeletons in the crypt don't attack.

In the hallway, [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] triggers a trapdoor, but manages a save. The party ties ropes around themselves and skirts around the edge. [[Grrurika]] fails 3 times and instead leaps across.

Through the cistern room, they find barracks with 3 [[Redbrands]] resting inside. The party discuss their plans in front of the door, giving the plan away to the ruffians inside.

**Combat**
> [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] douses the room with "Burning Hands," lighting the beds on fire. The party chips away at the [[Redbrands]], while the ruffians fail to do any damage back. They're caught in a bottlenecked room.
> [[Grrurika]] casts "Sacred Flame" into the room and a ruffian leaps out into the cistern to save himself. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] finishes him off by freezing the water.
> [[Grrurika]] storms into the room and kills a ruffian while [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] finishes the last one off.

The party head to the cells and corner the two guards.
**Combat**
> [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] kills a guard and [[Korah]] smashes the other into a statue. The blood splatters all over [[Nars Dendrar]], who will now have trauma for the rest of his life.

They release [[Mirna Dendrar]] and her children, [[Nars Dendrar|Nars]] and [[Nilsa Dendrar|Nilsa]]. She can't offer them a reward, but tells them of an heirloom she left behind in [[World/Locations/Thundertree|Thundertree]] when her family fled from the undead. She takes the children to [[Qelline Alderleaf]]'s farm.

**Quest**: [[Quests#^mirna-heirloom|Mirna's Heirloom]].

Outside, [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] is singing a calming song to the skeletons.

The party goes to the common room. The captain inside immediately recognises they're not [[Redbrands]] and initiates combat. The five ruffians are drunk.

**Combat**
> [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] kills the captain. [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] blasts a guard. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] freezes a guard while [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] finishes him. One guard flees while [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] kills the last one in the room.

[[Grrurika]] heals [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] while [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]], [[Korah]], and [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] drag bodies into the crevasse.

Meanwhile, [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] and [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] run after the fleeing ruffian, only to find themselves in a room with three Bugbears and [[Droop]], who faints. One of the bugbears is [[Klarg]], who has a [[Jewelled Eyepatch]].

> [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] casts "Burning Hands" into the room, damaging the bugbears and incinerating [[Droop]]. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] shields up and the two slowly advance back to the common room where there's more open space. [[Grrurika]] aids with a "Shield of Faith" on [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]].
> [[Grrurika]] nears kills [[Klarg]], but [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] gets the killing blow.
***NOTE: Let cool moves get the kill***
> [[Thia]] manages to damage the bugbears from the cavern as they run out of the room. One of them turns to her and attacks, downing her quickly. The other bugbear goes into the common room where [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] blasts him.
> [[Korah]] kills the last bugbear and the last surviving [[Redbrands|Redbrand]] guard.

**Tresendar cleared. Party levels up to 3 (Aric and Korah to 2.5).**
# Summary
Cleared [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor]] and deposited the bodies in the crevasse. [[Iarno Albrek]] got away, but the party found a letter from [[The Black Spider]] to [[Iarno Albrek|Iarno]] in the main quarters.
