## Day 2

Party wakes up in [[Stonehill Inn]] and meet [[Aric Moonshadow]] downstairs. He is in between adventures and is looking to join.

They return to the goblin ambush site on [[Triboar Trail]] to look for clues.

**Goblin Ambush**

Four more goblins have set up here. The party kills three, last one tries to flee.

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] knocks him out. The goblin, [[Toe Jam]] , agrees to lead the party to [[Cragmaw Cave]] in exchange for his life, avoiding the traps along the way.

Once they reach the cave, [[Aric Moonshadow]] executes [[Toe Jam]] with a dagger. The screams alert the guard goblins. [[Aric Moonshadow|Aric]] earns the title, [[Oathbreaker]]

**Encounter**

Two goblins fire from behind thickets. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] burns the thickets down while [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and [[Grrurika]] kill the goblins.

A stream runs through the cave. There's a chamber with three wolves chained to a pillar. [[Grrurika]] calms the wolves while [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] climb a chute at the back. At the top, [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] shines a torch into the opening, revealing a surprised [[Klarg]]. They slide back down the rope before [[Klarg]] can cut it, getting rope burn in the process.

Party follows the stream further in, coming across a bridge up above. They try to sneak past but are detected by a goblin guarding the bridge. The goblin shouts a warning before throwing javelins. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] casts "Sleep" on goblin.

A flood of water washes the entire party out of the cave.

**Short rest**
