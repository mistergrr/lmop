# Day 7 
- [[Eldon Tosscobble]] can't find shadows when sleeping. Level 1 exhaustion.
- [[Thia Galanodel]] Receives a vision from [[Oghma]], who consoles her and says he can provide some aid if she completes his quest, [[Reconsecrate the Altar]]. Says to visit [[Sister Garaele]] for information on how to perform the ritual.
- [[Grrurika]] also sees visions in her sleep. The vision urges her to seek out the [[Temple of the Dawning Light]], where she must undergo a trial to prove their remorse and dedication to restoring the balance between life and death.
- [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] dreams he's a puppy. The dream has no effect on real life.
- [[Dorian of Galdor]] dreams of [[Erynel]] and was up with stiff morning wood.

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] wakes up and collects his [[Wolf Head Cloak]]. He also sells some surplus weapons.
[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] and [[Grrurika]] visit [[Sister Garaele]], who explains how to conduct the ritual to reconsecrate the defiled altar. [[Grrurika]] also confirms that they should go to [[Helm's Hold]] to see about breaking their banes.
[[Dorian Blackthorne]] overhears the conversation and insists he join the party to help them bring the chaos to order (despite being a week away from retirement). He says he will see to it the banes are broken (whether they live or die). He is also heading to [[Helm's Hold]] to see if he can bring his Wild Magic in order.

[[Eldon Tosscobble]] and [[Dorian of Galdor]] check in on [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]]. [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggy]] says he enjoyed the wedding and is fine, but is too frail to travel with them. He wishes them luck and offers a round of drinks on him when they return.

The party hops on a coach to [[Helm's Hold]]. Onboard, [[Dorian of Galdor]] attempts to cast Sleep on [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] to help him sleep (forgetting the AoE). [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] does not feel any effects, but [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]], [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]], and [[Dorian Blackthorne|Dorian B]] do. He drops the spell and they snap out of it.

During the night, while the party rests at camp, [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] hears goblin chatter. He wakes [[Dorian Blackthorne|Dorian B]] who confirms goblins are about to attack. Both of them manage to wake [[Grrurika]] and [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian G]] before the goblins are upon them.

**Combat**
Six goblins are upon them, but [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian G]], [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]], and [[Grrurika]] get ready the fastest. However, [[Grrurika]] doesn't have time to don armour. [[Dorian of Galdor]] opens with Magic Missile and spreads the attack. [[Thia]] casts Ray of Frost on the goblin boss. [[Grrurika]] swings her hammer at a goblin blackblade, but misses.

A couple of the goblins are nimble and combat roll behind players to backstab them. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] and [[Grrurika]] are the main targets. They take heavy damage.

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] struggles to find an advantageous position and doesn't manage any sneak attacks this battle. [[Dorian Blackthorne|Dorian B]] keeps at range and launches Magic Missiles.

The three regular goblins take their positions and attack [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and [[Grrurika]]. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] one-shots one of these goblins. His strength diminishes a little.

[[Grrurika]] kills the goblin on her. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] also kills a goblin, but this draws fire on herself. The goblin boss and blackblade take [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] down, but she's quickly revived by [[Grrurika]]. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] injures a blackblade, and [[Dorian Blackthorne|Dorian B]] finishes it off.

[[Dorian of Galdor]] tries to cast a spell, but his energies twist, causing him to cast Confusion centred on himself. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]], the goblin boss, and himself are affected. In her confusion, [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] flees west, away from danger. The goblin boss also flees west in his confusion, but the effects of Ray of Frost mean he stops far short of [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]].

Richtor kills the last blackblade. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] can finally use their aimed shots and takes a couple of rounds to finish off the goblin boss with a crossbow.

They go back to sleep and [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] successfully falls asleep, removing any effects of exhaustion. #rest 

# Day 8
They rest of the journey passes without event and they arrive outside [[Helm's Hold]] in the evening. Everyone in the party besides [[Grrurika]] are forced to pay an entrance fee and turn in their armour while in the city. [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian G]] asks if he can see the list of people who have entered the city but is told he needs permission to do so.

[[Grrurika]] has been here before and leads the way. The party stop at [[Heartward]] when they see the ghosts. [[Dorian Blackthorne]] senses that the ghosts aren't on the Material Plane, but the divide is thin and the Planes are overlapped here. They're spooked until [[Grrurika]] explains that that's a nightly occurrence and they have nothing to fear. She leads them to the [[Cathedral of Helm]] and they head down to find [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]]

[[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] and [[Grrurika]] exchange warm welcomes. [[Satarin]] gets lost in a tangent, making sure none have contracted lycanthropy of any sort. The party explains their banes one-by-one.

One-by-one, he provides avenues they can explore to find redemption.

- [[Quests#Dorian's Penance]] is to find places of unstable magical energy and bring them into focus.
- [[Quests#Eldon's Penance]] is to find the [[Shadow Codex]], probably in a library somewhere. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] asks if the [[Library of Whispers]] might contain it. [[Satarin]] says certainly, but the [[Library of Whispers]] is currently lost to time. They may have to find clues to its location via others who also seek the library.
- [[Quests#Grrurika's Penance]]. The [[Temple of the Dawning Light]] is located somewhere in the [[Neverwinter Wood]], but he doesn't know where exactly. All he knows is she needs to find "Edal's Crotch" to locate it.
- [[Quests#Richtor's Penance]] may be to head to [[Endurance Hill]], where a temple of [[Torm]] is located. There have been tales of warriors who face the trials of strength there.
- [[Quests#Thia's Penance]] in the [[Library of Whispers]] is sure to cure her of forgotten knowledge.
- Unfortunately for [[Dorian Blackthorne]], there is no known cure for Wild Magic sorcerers, but he can try while [[Dorian of Galdor]] is focusing his.
- [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian G]] also asks if he can get permission to see the log of travellers into [[Helm's Hold]]. He's told that only [[Rohini]] can grant that kind of access, but he'll need to gain her trust first.

The party then make for an inn to rest the night. At the edge of [[Heartward]], they see a tall figure bunny-hopping around the ghosts. The creature comes up to them and asks for help. It's [[Ruby Roo]], a kangaroo whose home is overrun by "monsters." The party agree to help, but only after a good night's sleep. They head to the [[Old Dirty Dwarf]] with [[Ruby Roo|Ruby]].

[[Juetta]] tells them animals aren't allowed, so [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] heads upstairs and steals a disguise from one of the rooms. He comes back down and heads outside with [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and [[Grrurika]] to disguise [[Ruby Roo|Ruby]]. The disguise isn't great, but the inn is busy, so they manage to get away with leading [[Ruby Roo|Ruby]] straight upstairs and into [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor's]] room.

[[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian G]] pisses off the bouncer, [[Thoril]], by making a remark about orcs. He also asks [[Juetta]] if she's seen [[Erynel]], but she hasn't. [[Grrurika]] sings a song at the karaoke station and gets a free room and a few rounds of drink.

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and [[Dorian Blackthorne|Dorian B]] head to bed. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Grrurika]] also go upstairs, but the temptation of the 3rd floor gets to them and they decide to break in.

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] picks the lock and they step into the room. The room is empty, save for 5 bedrolls at the centre and a chest against the far wall. The chest has a big lock on it. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] grabs the lock to pick it, but finds himself adhered to it.

**Combat**
The chest opens to reveal a monstrous maw and bites [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]]. It does bludgeoning as well as acid damage. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] tries attacking it back, but misses. [[Grrurika]] takes a big swing at the grapple point, risking hitting [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]]. The hits, but . [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] manages to push free, but the mimics next attack grapples him again.

Downstairs, [[Dorian of Galdor]] hears a thump and calls [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] to investigate.

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] is on very low health. [[Grrurika]] reaches out to heal but her bane causes her to siphon life instead (even after spending inspiration to re-roll). This drops [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] to 0 hit points.

[[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] and [[Dorian of Galdor]] arrive at the door and see an unconscious [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] being attacked by a monstrous chest while [[Grrurika]] attacks it with a hammer. They join the fight. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] rushes in and heals [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]], waking him up. [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian G]] hits the mimic with magic missile.

The mimic reduces [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] to 0 hit points again. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] grabs [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and pulls back, breaking the grapple and sending them flying backwards. The mimic turns its attention to [[Grrurika]] but she fends it off with her shield.

A cone of fire erupts from [[Thia Galanodel|Thia's]] hands, burning the mimic to a crisp. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] wakes up and searches the mimic's body for loot, but it wasn't carrying anything. He goes to bed, dejected.

Everyone heads to bed to #rest
