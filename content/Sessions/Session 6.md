# Day 4 | Leaving Tresendar
[[Aric Moonshadow]] and [[Korah]] are called away and leave through the tunnel. The rest of the party leave through the cistern. They emerge amongst the rubble of what's left of [[World/History/Places/Tresendar Manor|Tresendar Manor]].

**Combat**
> The [[Redbrands|Redbrand]] who fled in the morning has returned with backup: 3 [[Redbrands]] and 2 [[Bugbear]]s. Two melee ruffians and a bugbear lock into battle with [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and [[Grrurika]] while the two ruffian archers stand back and shoot. The remaining bugbear goes after the nearest open target — [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]]
> 
> [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] and [[Grrurika]] attack well, but are overwhelmed as [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] is hammered by the bugbear.
> 
> [[Dorian of Galdor]] enters mid-fight, behind the two archers. He recognises [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and helps in the battle. He sneak attacks with "Magic Missile" on an archer, killing him in one attack. The party don't notice him yet.
> 
> [[Grrurika]] holds off attacks while healing [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]]. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] gets in position behind the original ruffian and slashes an X across his back, killing him. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] tries putting the bugbear to sleep, but he has too much health and is still dealing a lot of damage.
> 
> [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] is doing good damage to the bugbear in from of him, causing it to bleed profusely, but it's still not going down. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] uses "Ray of Frost," but is still taking a lot of damage. [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] comes to the rescue, leaping onto the bugbear and stabbing it.
> 
> [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] dodges the archer's shots and crits with "Magic Missile," killing him.
> 
> The bugbear throws [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] off of him, sending [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggy]] crashing into the rubble. [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggy]] crumples in a heap. 
> 
> [[Dorian]] now helps [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] out, casting "Fire Bolt" on the bugbear. It's a crit, but he does low damage. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] notices [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] then shifts focus to the ruffian and slashes a deep wound into him.
> 
> [[Grrurika]] heals [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] and [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] The bugbear shifts its focus to her, giving [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] a breather. He's doing a lot of damage to everyone. 
> 
> [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] casts "Magic Missile" again, directing one bolt to the bugbear and the other two to the last ruffian. They're all kill shot and [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] nabs a two-for-one.
> 
> The final bugbear manages to down [[Grrurika]]. [[Thia]] disengages to drag [[Grrurika]] to safety, stabilising her. [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]], in a fit of rage against the bugbear, jumps onto its back and stabs it to death, decapitating it and throwing its head against the rubble.

Everyone sees [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] now and [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] reunites, introducing him to the gang. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] leads everyone to the shrine for healing. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] carries [[Grrurika]] there.

[[Sister Garaele]] is alarmed by the state of the gang and works hard to heal everyone. [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] is extremely worn down and goes home. The gang heads to [[Stonehill Inn]] to celebrate wiping out the [[Redbrands]]. Everyone drinks two gallons of ale (except [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]], who only has one) and gets familiar with [[Dorian of Galdor]].

[[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]], [[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]], and [[Grrurika]] engage in tortoise racing — Dorian wins. Everybody heads to bed. [[Grrurika]] learns about [[Lightbringer]].

# Day 5 | Ziggy's Secret
**Dorian**
The party goes back to [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor|Tresendar]] to loot bodies. [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] goes to the nearby forest to gather spell components.

**Eldon and Richtor**
[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] and [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] go to town hall to suss if [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] is also working with [[The Black Spider]]. [[Harbin Wester]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] are very alarmed and worried about the carved up Redbrand bodies that were strung up in town square. [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] explains to them that they cleared the town of [[Redbrands]], but [[Iarno Albrek]] got away. **+3 Town #rep**.

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] searches [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]]'s thing to see if he's bad. Nothing nefarious turns up, so he gives [[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] a thumbs up.

[[Richtor Helmsley III|Richtor]] shows [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] the letter from [[The Black Spider]] to [[Iarno Albrek|Iarno]]. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] deduces that [[Iarno Albrek|Iarno]] ***is*** [[Iarno Albrek]], surprising everybody. He encourages the party to capture and bring [[Iarno Albrek|Iarno]] to him, so he can face justice.

**Grrurika and Thia**
[[Grrurika]] and [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] are very worried about [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]]. They knock on his door, but there's no answer. At the inn, no one has seen him, which is unusual. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] is beside herself with worry. They go back to [[Ziggywix's house]] and break the window with a rock.

[[Grrurika]] finds [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggy]] fast asleep in bed and leaves a glass of water for him. [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] finds an open [[Ziggywix's letter|letter]] on the desk and reads it. Shocked by the letter, she regroups with everyone and shares it with them.

Sheepishly, everyone goes back to [[Ziggywix's house]] to return the letter. He's awake and [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] explains the broken window. She sits him down and apologises for prying. He's relieved that he finally has someone to share his pain with.

[[Eldon Tosscobble|Eldon]] hugs [[Ziggywix Tinkerton|Ziggywix]] and [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] promises to fix the window.
