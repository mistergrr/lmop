# Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll. Each day of inscription takes 8 hours. Multiple days needn't be consecutive. Spells need to be prepared before scribing. If the spell consumes its components, it does so when the scroll is complete. The scroll's spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC.
**Proficiency**: Calligrapher's tools or arcana.
