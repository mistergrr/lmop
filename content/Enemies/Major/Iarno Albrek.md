**Description**: Former member of the Lord's Alliance. Used his connections and influence to expand his network and power.
> Had a son, [[Deuteronomy Albrek]], who died. Hasn't been the same since. Blames himself for not being able to protect his son.


# Goal
Trying to revive his dead son, [[Deuteronomy Albrek]]. He hears his son calling out to him in his sleep. His son's spirit is in the [[Arboreal Plane]]

**Role in Story**:
His [[Redbrands]] were eliminated by the party in [[Session 5]], and he has fled into hiding. He holds only a minor grudge and, instead of removing the party, has figured out he should *use* them to his own ends. He becomes the party's elusive patron; giving them quests and rewards via a messenger. The quests for the party are the tasks he was going to give the Redbrands.
**Tasks**

![[Quests#^obtain-relic1]
![[Quests#^obtain-relic2]]
![[Quests#^obtain-tome]]

**Secrets**
- He has [[Dorian of Galdor]]'s lover, [[Erynel]] and is planning on using them to access the [[Arboreal Plane]] bring his son back to life.
- He has been practicing necromancy. Raised the skeletons in [[World/Locations/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor|Tresendar Crypt]]
- Visited [[Library of Whispers]] with [[Erynel]] to find information about bringing his son back from the [[Arboreal Plane]].
- Has his son's body in a state of suspension in order for the souls to have a place to return to. The state of suspension should have expired by now, but he's using necromancy to keep it going. It's unstable after this long and he's worried he can't keep it up for much longer.
- Struggles with the morality of his actions. Grapples with questions about the consequences of attempts at resurrection—whether it is right to bring someone back from the dead and what impact it may have on their soul. [[Erynel]] is a strong voice in this conflict (although he himself is conflicted by his plans of revenge).
- Initially viewed [[Erynel]] as a means to an end—someone who can help him achieve his goal. However, as their relationship deepens, he begins to see him as a reflection of his son, which might make his guilt more pronounced. [[Erynel|Erynel's]] presence may remind him of what he has lost, leading to moments of vulnerability where he opens up about his past and the mistakes he made. This could foster a bond based on shared pain and understanding, as [[Erynel]] himself is an outcast seeking belonging.
