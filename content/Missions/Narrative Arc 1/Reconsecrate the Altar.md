# Mission
Goblins have defiled a shrine once sacred to [[Oghma]]. They've now dedicated it to [[Maglubiyet]], the vile goblin god of war. Rededicate it to Oghma

[[Sister Garaele]] may help with info. She can create a [[Scroll of Ceremony]] if they don't have holy water.

# Location
[[Cragmaw Castle]]

# The Ritual
- **Cleansing the Ground:** Spreading **Holy Water** (provided by [[Sister Garaele]] or created with [[Scroll of Ceremony]] (XGtE pg 151)) around the altar.
-  **Reciting the Sacred Words:** The adventurers must remember and recite a prayer or chant. A skill check (e.g. Religion) may be required to perform it correctly.
- **Offering a Sacrifice:** A small offering that reflects the values of wisdom, learning, and the pursuit of truth must be placed in the Purified Chalice and left on the altar. (eg. a rare tome or scroll, a scholar's quill, a map, the adventurers could each write down a personal revelation or piece of wisdom they’ve learned on their journeys and offer it to Oghma, an illuminated manuscript.)

>"Three guardians stand in silent embrace,  
One guards the past, one guards the space.  
The third awaits, in shadows deep,  
For those who seek the truths they keep.

>To find the path, you must discern,  
The order in which their secrets turn.  
First, the keeper of bygone days,  
Next, the one who guards the maze.  
Lastly, the one in silence stays,  
Whose name will guide you through the haze.

>Align their truths in proper array,  
And the entrance to knowledge will be displayed."
