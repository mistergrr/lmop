# The Search for the Library of Whispers

The [[Tome of Eternal Recall]] is hidden in an ancient, forgotten library known only in myth — [[Library of Whispers]]. This library was said to be a repository of all knowledge, including secrets that even the gods coveted. However, it was sealed away by the gods themselves to prevent mortals from accessing its power.

The wizards must first gather clues to the library’s location. This might involve:

- **Recovering Ancient Maps or Texts**: Pieces of the map to the [[Library of Whispers]] are scattered across different lands, guarded by powerful entities, hidden in lost temples, or protected by ancient wards.
- **Consulting with Lost Scholars**: The wizards must find and communicate with the spirits of long-dead scholars who once visited the library. This may require necromantic rituals or visiting ethereal planes, and the spirits may demand a price for their knowledge.
- **Unraveling the Riddle of the Library**: The final clue might be a riddle or puzzle that, when solved, reveals the entrance to the [[Library of Whispers]], hidden in a place where the boundary between reality and the arcane is thin — such as a nexus of ley lines or a forgotten magical city.

The [[Library of Whispers]] is a place of immense power but also great danger. It exists partially outside of time, where knowledge and memory are fluid, and even reality itself can be unreliable. Within the library, the wizards encounter:

- **Guardian of the Library**: A powerful spirit that protect the knowledge lives within, testing the wizards’ worthiness through trials of intellect, wisdom, and magical skill.


# Who Wants to be a Wizardaire
Deep within the library, the wizards find the [[Tome of Eternal Recall]]. However, the tome is not just a book; it is a sentient artifact, bound by powerful magic and a guardian of its own. To claim it, the wizards must:
  
- **Defeat the Guardian's Quiz**: The final guardian of the tome could be a powerful, forgotten mage who sought to keep the knowledge for themselves. This guardian could be a formidable foe, requiring the wizards to use all their remaining knowledge and skill to defeat them.
- **Understand the Tome’s True Nature**: The tome might require the wizard  to bind their own essence to the tome, becoming its new caretakers. Losing the Tome or breaking the attunement to it means losing all memories of magic.
- 
## The Quiz
The Guardian runs the quiz like "Who Want to be a Millionaire." The questions test the wizard's knowledge of their spells and decision making skills. At the start of the game, an [[Archmage]] (99HP) is presented, magically tied up. It's explained that the mage tried to break in and steal knowledge. Before each round, [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] must choose a spell from her _learned spells_ list to cast on the mage for free. The spell automatically hits. Once a spell is cast, it cannot be chosen again for 3 rounds.

- With every **correct question**, [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] casts her chosen spell on the mage. 
- With every **incorrect** question, a punishment is chosen by random — they can include reflecting the damage back to [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] or a spell is chosen for her.

**Involving the party**: The wizard can "phone a friend." They're limited to calling each friend once and only have 2 minutes to discuss the question.


# Step 4: Restoring Knowledge
Upon winning the game, the reward is the [[Tome of Eternal Recall]].
- Borrow one other book. Possibly [[Shadow Codex]]

The tome allows the wizard to regain all the spells and lore they had forgotten, and it grants them the ability to protect their minds from future forgetfulness. However, the restoration is not immediate and might require a ritual or period of study where the wizards must inscribe the recovered knowledge into their spell books and meditate to reabsorb it.

# Step 5: The Boon of Eternal Recall

As a reward for their perseverance, the [[Tome of Eternal Recall]] grants the wizards a boon:

- **The Gift of Memory**: The wizard gains a permanent +1 increase to their Intelligence score, reflecting their heightened understanding and mental acuity. They may also gain the ability to share or protect memories, allowing them to help others recall lost knowledge or guard against memory-altering effects.
- **Divine Clarity** Once per day, gain the ability to recall any detail, fact, or event with perfect accuracy. This blessing also enables them to instantly retrieve any information they’ve previously encountered, including languages and complex lore. "A soft, golden light envelops the recipient’s head, symbolising the divine touch on their mind."
or 
- They learn:
	- 3rd Remove bane
	- 4th Private Sanctum
	- 2nd Detect Thoughts
	- 3rd Tongues
	- 

# The Aftermath

With their knowledge restored, the wizards emerge more powerful and wise. However, the [[Library of Whispers]] and the [[Tome of Eternal Recall]] remain potent forces in the world. The wizards may find themselves drawn into further adventures involving the pursuit of lost knowledge, or they might become guardians of the tome, protecting it from those who would misuse its power.

This journey not only removes the bane but also deepens the wizards' connection to their arcane studies, turning their loss of knowledge into an epic quest for enlightenment and mastery over magic.
