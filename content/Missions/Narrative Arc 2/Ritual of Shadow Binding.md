## Concept

The rogue must perform an ancient ritual to bind their soul to the shadows once more, restoring their lost ability.

## The Journey

### Finding the Shadow Codex:
The rogue learns of a rare, ancient tome called the _[[Shadow Codex]]_, which contains the ritual for binding one’s essence to the shadows. 
- Lighting a torch in the dark draws shadows to attack. The rogue must lose themselves in the darkness in order to progress safely.
- There are traps that require high perception to find and disarm.
### Gathering the Ritual Components: 
The ritual requires rare and dangerous components, such as three essences of a shadow, midnight water, and a shadow spider's web. The rogue must embark on a series of quests to obtain these components, each presenting unique challenges that involve stealth, combat, and cleverness.

#### 1. Wisp of Shadow (Umbral Dust):
- **Quest:** The rogue must defeat or outmanoeuvre three shadows to capture their essence. Each shadow could represent a different aspect of the rogue’s inner darkness or fears, making the encounters not just physical but also psychological.
- **Environment:** The rogue might find these shadows in locations tied to their past, such as a dark alley from a previous mission or an old hideout.
#### 2. Midnight Water:
- **Quest:** The rogue must find a hidden spring where shadows gather at midnight. This could involve a journey through a dark forest or an ancient ruin. The challenge is to collect the water at the exact moment when the shadows are at their peak.
- The water appears pitch black at night, yet has a faint shimmer.
#### 3. Shadow Spider’s Web:
- **Quest:** The rogue must venture into a cave or abandoned temple infested with shadow spiders. These creatures are stealthy and deadly, making the rogue’s approach crucial.
- **Combat/Stealth Challenge:** The rogue could choose to stealthily avoid the spiders and take the web, or they could engage them in combat and harvest their web sacs. The web itself might be located in a well-guarded area, requiring the rogue to use their skills to reach it without alerting the entire nest.

### Performing the Ritual:
- Once the components are gathered, the rogue must perform the ritual in The [[Forgotten Temple of Shar]]. It is a place of deep darkness, such as a shadowy cave or an ancient crypt. The ritual requires precise timing and focus, and the rogue may face visions or illusions that try to break their concentration. Successfully completing the ritual rebinds their soul to the shadows, restoring their lost ability.
- Lighting a torch in the dark draws shadows to attack. The rogue must lose themselves in the darkness in order to progress safely.
- There are traps that require high perception to find and disarm.

## The Reward

- **Shadow Affinity**: The rogue’s connection to the shadows is restored, giving them Darkvision and advantage on all stealth checks in darkness and dim light as well as resistance to shadow-based attacks or effects.
