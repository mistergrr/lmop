# Step 1: The Sacred Arena

The Battle Master learns of a sacred arena where warriors are tested by a deity of strength or war (such as Kord, Tempus, or an equivalent in your campaign world). This arena exists in a remote, dangerous location, like atop a mountain or within a hidden temple deep in the wilderness. Reaching the arena itself is a test, as the path is fraught with challenges that require the Battle Master to think strategically rather than rely solely on brute force.

# Step 2: The Challenge of the Champions

Once in the arena, the Battle Master faces a series of powerful champions, each representing a different aspect of martial prowess:

1. **The Tactician**: A skilled warrior who outmaneuvers the Battle Master, forcing them to rely on strategy and quick thinking rather than raw power. The Tactician sets traps and uses the environment to their advantage, challenging the Battle Master to anticipate and counter their moves.
2. **The Berserker**: A relentless foe whose strength grows with each strike, mirroring the Battle Master’s curse. The Battle Master must learn to outlast and outthink the Berserker, using endurance and tactical retreats rather than engaging in a direct contest of strength.
3. **The Guardian**: A heavily armoured warrior who cannot be bested by sheer force. The Battle Master must find and exploit weaknesses in the Guardian’s defence, using precision strikes and cunning to win the fight.
4. **The Duelist**: A nimble and skilled fighter who excels in one-on-one combat. The Battle Master must match their skill and technique, relying on discipline and focus rather than brute strength.

# Step 3: The Final Trial - The Test of Sacrifice

After defeating the champions, the Battle Master faces the final trial, a manifestation of their own diminished strength. This trial could be an apparition of themselves at full power, a reflection of the warrior they used to be. This manifestation taunts the Battle Master, challenging them to prove they are more than just their physical strength.

In this battle, the Battle Master’s attacks grow weaker with each successful hit, mirroring the effects of the curse. To win, the Battle Master must realise that victory doesn’t lie in overpowering their foe but in enduring and outlasting the apparition. They might have to sacrifice their weapon, accept blows without retaliation, or demonstrate a profound act of humility or mercy, showing that they can still be a great warrior even when their strength is gone.

# Step 4: The Reward

Upon completing the trial, the deity of strength acknowledges the Battle Master’s endurance and resolve. The curse is lifted, and as a reward, the Battle Master may receive a boon:

- **The Blessing of Endurance**: A permanent increase to their Constitution or the ability to temporarily ignore exhaustion or damage penalties in critical moments.
- **Bring Honour to Your Family**: [[Thunderclap]] gains +1

This trial not only breaks the curse but also imparts a valuable lesson to the Battle Master, reinforcing that true strength is as much about wisdom, strategy, and endurance as it is about physical power.
