# Concept

The wizard must perform a focused arcane ritual at a site of powerful magical convergence to stabilise their chaotic magic.

# Finding the Right Location

The Arcane Convergence ritual requires a place of strong magical resonance. However, the specifics of the location are up to the players' creativity and exploration. Possible clues and hints could guide them to places like:

- **Ley Line Intersections**: Anywhere two or more ley lines cross can serve as a powerful focal point. These might be discovered in ancient maps, through magical divination, or by following signs of unusual natural phenomena.
- **Forgotten Sanctuaries**: Abandoned or hidden magical sanctuaries, each with its unique history and challenges, could be repurposed for the ritual.
- **Elemental Sites**: Locations deeply connected to a particular element (e.g., a volcano for fire, a glacier for ice) might be suitable, especially if the wizards seek to align their elemental resistance with the environment.
- **Natural Convergences**: Natural sites like a secluded grove, a mystical waterfall, or the eye of a storm where magic feels particularly potent. 
## Possible Locations
- [[Cradle of Life]]
- [[Library of Whispers]]
- [[Wave Echo Cave]]
- Dragon's tower in [[World/Locations/Thundertree|Thundertree]]
- Wizard tower in [[Old Owl Well]]

#  Ritual Components and Preparation
The ritual requires gathering powerful magical components that reflect the unique nature of the chosen site:

- **Essence of the Location**: This could be anything that embodies the site's power—lava from a volcano, a shard of crystal from a ley line nexus, or a drop of water from a sacred spring.
- **Harmonic Focus**: A magical item or relic that aligns the energies of the site with the wizards' intentions. This might need to be crafted, enchanted, or found through an adventure.
- **Elemental Anchors**: To gain elemental resistance, the ritual may require attuning to specific elements, such as forging anchors out of fire, ice, or other elemental materials found or created at the site.

# The Ritual Process

The players must adapt the ritual to fit the chosen site, taking into account its unique properties:

- **Tailored Runes**: The runes used in the ritual should resonate with the location. For example, in a volcanic site, the runes might be etched into molten rock, while in a forest, they could be carved into ancient trees.
- **Environmental Challenges**: The site may present natural or magical challenges during the ritual. The players must overcome or mitigate these challenges to ensure the convergence stabilises. Examples include:
    - **Volcanic Eruptions**: In a volcanic site, the ritual might trigger eruptions or lava flows.
    - **Elemental Manifestations**: In an elemental site, powerful elemental creatures might appear, drawn by the disturbance. The rest of the party have to fight off the elementals while [[Dorian of Galdor|Dorian]] conducts the ritual.
	    - [[Richtor Helmsley III]], [[Grrurika]] [[Thia Galanodel]] [[Eldon Tosscobble]]
    - **Weather Phenomena**: In a stormy location, the ritual could intensify the storm, with lightning strikes or gale-force winds threatening the wizards.

# Outcomes and Elemental Resistance Boon

Upon successful completion, the wizards gain:

- **Elemental Resistance**: The wizards attune to the element connected to their chosen site, gaining resistance to that element’s damage type (e.g., fire resistance from a volcano).
- **Site-Specific Effects**: Depending on the location, the ritual might impart additional minor effects. For example, in a forest, they might gain a temporary boost to nature-based spells or abilities, or in a stormy location, they could develop resistance to being pushed or knocked down by wind.

# Player-Driven Discovery and Interpretation

Allow the players to uncover clues about possible locations through lore, exploration, or interaction with NPCs. Each potential site can offer different flavours and challenges, encouraging them to think strategically about where they perform the Arcane Convergence.

This approach will make the Arcane Convergence a more dynamic and player-driven experience, with the elemental resistance boon as a fitting reward for their efforts.
