# Story Beats
## 1. Opening Image
**Curse of the Dead Hand**: The cleric’s connection to life-giving energy is corrupted. When they use any ability or spell that involves laying hands on an ally, there’s a chance that instead of healing, they siphon vitality from the target, dealing necrotic damage equal to half the intended healing amount. The damage taken by the target is then transferred to the cleric as temporary hit points, creating a twisted cycle of life and death.
## 2. The Set-up
The journey begins with a divine vision granted to the cleric during meditation. In the vision, the cleric witnesses the fading spark of the God of Birth, flickering weakly in the void where the deity once thrived. A disembodied voice—perhaps the remnants of the god themselves or a messenger from another divine being—tells the cleric that the spark can still be rekindled, but it requires a pilgrimage to a sacred site where [[Lathander]] once held power.

**Purpose:** The vision urges the cleric to seek out the [[Temple of the Dawning Light]], where they must undergo a trial to prove their remorse and dedication to restoring the balance between life and death.
## 3. Catalyst
- The cleric and their party must navigate the [[Cradle of Life]], a mystical grove where new life once flourished under the god’s blessing. Now, the place is withering, overrun by undead or other blights. **Shadows and shadow spiders.** The cleric must purify the area, restoring its natural balance by performing rituals and possibly confronting the forces of death that have taken hold.
	- Possible location for [[The Arcane Convergence]]
- **Guiding Light:** As they approach the temple, the cleric notices a dim, flickering light that only they can see, guiding them through the dense, twisted forest. The light grows stronger as they get closer, symbolizing their dwindling connection to [[Lathander]] and their hope for redemption.
- Epic boss fight — Blighted enemy
- **Theme** Life OR Death
## 4. Unclear World
- The cleric's healing spell now siphons life from one target and heals another for the amount of damage dealt.
## 5. The Hero Transition (Break into Act 2)
- They enter the [[Temple of the Dawning Light]].
- Inside is a possible clue about the location of the [[Library of Whispers]] — Mural.
## 6. Promise of the Premise
- **The Hall of Mirrors:** Inside the temple, the cleric finds themselves in a hall filled with mirrors that reflect their past, present, and potential future. Each reflection represents a different aspect of their journey—moments of heroism, failure, and the looming shadow of the curse. Some reflections may try to speak to them, offering advice or attempting to dissuade them from their quest.
- **Echoes of the Past:** As they move deeper into the temple, they hear echoes of past conversations, prayers, and pleas for healing from those they’ve harmed unintentionally due to the curse. These echoes grow louder as they approach the central chamber, weighing heavily on their conscience.
## 7. A Major Victory (Midpoint)
 **The Hand of Redemption:** In the central chamber lies the artifact—the [[Hand of Redemption]], a radiant, yet slightly cracked, hand-shaped relic. Touching it will trigger the trial, pulling the cleric into a vision or alternate realm where they must confront the full weight of their actions.
## 8. Bad Guys Close In
**The Veil of Lathander**
- Upon touching the [[Hand of Redemption]], the cleric is enveloped in a golden veil of light, which transports them to a dreamlike realm. This realm is a manifestation of [[Lathander]]’s divine essence, filled with a serene dawn landscape—a place where the sun is eternally rising, casting long shadows that stretch unnaturally far.

**The Path of Echoes**
- The cleric finds themselves on a narrow, winding path that floats above a sea of shimmering light. Along the path, they hear echoes—voices of those they’ve healed, saved, or helped throughout their journey. These voices speak of gratitude, but as the cleric progresses, the echoes shift to voices of those who were harmed by the curse, expressing pain, fear, and betrayal.
- As the cleric moves forward, they must face illusions of these individuals. Each illusion presents a moral challenge, such as confronting an ally who distrusts them because of the curse or meeting a spectral version of themselves who tempts them to embrace the curse’s power. These challenges test the cleric's resolve, compassion, and willingness to confront the consequences of their actions.
## 9. All is Lost
**The Trial of Wills**
- After the Path of Echoes, the cleric arrives at a crossroads guarded by three entities, each representing a different aspect of their struggle. The cleric must confront each entity in order to pass:
    - **The Tempter:** A shadowy figure with eyes glowing with necrotic energy, representing the temptation to embrace the curse’s power for greater strength. This entity whispers promises of unmatched power and eternal life if the cleric would only submit to the curse. They must resist the allure of power and reject the entity’s offers, proving their dedication to their original path. Take necrotic damage either way.
    - **The Judge:** A radiant, stern figure that embodies justice and balance. This entity demands that the cleric account for their past actions and make a choice: to be judged by the weight of their sins or to judge themselves. Take psychic damage for each sin.
    - **The Healer:** A gentle, sorrowful figure bathed in a soft light, representing the cleric’s original devotion to healing and life. This entity offers the cleric forgiveness but warns that true redemption requires sacrifice. They must undergo a test of empathy, where they relive the suffering they’ve caused others through the curse, feeling their pain as their own. Take necrotic damage equal to all the necrotic damage they have dealt up to now.

## 10. Dark Night of the Soul
**The Chamber of the Hand**
- Upon passing the Trial of Wills, the cleric should be low on health. They're transported to the **Chamber of the Hand**. Here, the [[Hand of Redemption]] floats above a radiant altar, its light is flickering as if dying out.
- As the cleric approaches, they are faced with the final decision:
    - **The Path of Power:** The cleric can grip the [[Hand of Redemption]] tightly, absorbing its vitality to heal themselves but at the cost of transitioning to the death domain. The light within the chamber dims, and a shadowy aura surrounds the cleric as they embrace their new, darker powers.
    - **The Path of Sacrifice:** The cleric can lay their hands gently on the [[Hand of Redemption]] and sacrifice their own life in order to restore the hand. This act of humility and selflessness purifies their soul, breaking the curse and enhancing their connection to the life domain. The chamber fills with a brilliant, blinding light, symbolizing their redemption and strengthened healing abilities.
## 11. Finale (Break into Act 3)
** Redemption or Damnation**
	- **If They Chose Power:** The cleric leaves the Chamber of the Hand marked by darkness. Their powers are formidable, but they are further corrupted, burdened with the consequences of their decisions.
	- **If They Chose Sacrifice:** The cleric emerges from the Chamber of the Hand bathed in a radiant glow, their curse lifted, and their healing abilities greatly enhanced. Their allies may view them with renewed respect and trust, having witnessed their selflessness and commitment to the light.
	- **Narrative Impact:** The outcome of the trial will significantly affect the cleric’s future, their relationship with their allies, and their standing with [[Lathander]] or other divine entities.

# **Rewards:**

- **Lightbringer's Aura:** The cleric gains an aura that extends 10 feet around them, which can be activated as a bonus action. While active, this aura sheds bright light in the area, and any ally within the aura gains temporary hit points equal to the cleric’s Wisdom modifier at the start of their turn. Additionally, any undead creature that enters the aura or starts its turn there takes radiant damage equal to the cleric’s Wisdom modifier. The aura can be maintained for 1 minute, and it can be used once per long rest.
-OR-
- **Gift of the Dawn**. The cleric permanently gains resistance to necrotic damage and advantage on saving throws against death effects. Additionally, any creature brought back from 0 hit points by the cleric’s healing spells also gains temporary hit points equal to the cleric’s Wisdom modifier.
- **Divine Radiance:** The cleric’s appearance subtly changes, with a faint, warm glow always surrounding them. Their eyes may carry the light of dawn, and their touch is comforting, reminiscent of the first light of morning.
- **Sacred Relic:** The [[Hand of Redemption]], a powerful holy symbol that enhances healing spells and grants advantage on death-saving throws.
- The cleric can choose to follow [[Lathander]] as their new deity.

or

- **The bane of the Dead Hand evolves**. Once per long rest, when the cleric is reduced to 0HP, they automatically cast ***Life Transference*** (XGtE pg. 160) at the highest slot level (without spending the spell slot) to siphon vitality from the nearest *ally* within 30ft. The spell deals half the rolled number as damage (rounded down) and heals yourself for the full amount rolled.
- The cleric forgoes their domain of life, swapping instead to the **Death Domain** (DMG pg. 96)
- **Cursed Dominion:** Embracing the death domain grants the cleric additional necromantic powers, but at a cost. Their healing spells and abilities can still be used normally, but each use risks intensifying the curse. For every three instances where they successfully heal without triggering the curse, the chance of triggering **Bane of the Shadowed Hand** increases by 10% for the next healing attempt, resetting only after a long rest.
- 
- "***Toll of the Dead****" cantrip
- "***Life Transference****" 3rd level spell
## If domain changes
Give [[Thia Galanodel|Thia]] Magic Initiate (Cleric) feat. (PHB pg. 168)

# **Roleplaying Tips:**

- **DM Guidance:** As the DM, focus on creating a tense and emotionally charged atmosphere. Use descriptive language to highlight the weight of the cleric’s decisions and the gravity of the trial.
- **Player Involvement:** Encourage the player to fully engage with the moral and emotional aspects of the trial. This is a chance for deep character development and should feel like a pivotal moment in the cleric’s story.

This quest wraps up the session in a powerful, emotionally charged story, leaving the cleric forever changed by their journey towards redemption.
