# Notes

# Background
- Spent her life dedicated to [[Oghma]], spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.
- Spent so long in the temple, she has poor social skills.
- Oghma delivers visions through her trances, sending her on quests.
# Goals
Reconsecrate the defiled altar.
- A shrine one dedicated to Oghma has been defiled by the goblins of [[Cragmaw Castle]]
- It's now dedicated to the vile goblin-god [[Maglubiyet]]

# Connections

- [[Dorian of Galdor]]
- [[Grrurika]]
	- Clue to [[Library of Whispers]] found in [[Cradle of Life]]

# Plot Ideas
Transition to Wild-Magic Sorcerer. Or use Shadowdark spellcasting rules.
- Lose spellbook. (Only keep prepared spells)
- Sorcerer sources:
	- Water from a magical spring
	- Exposure to the elemental forces of the inner planes
	- Touch of a deity/demon
- Or death and resurrection.
# Curse
**Bane of Forgotten Knowledge**: The wizard begins to forget key spells and lore they once knew. Each day, they lose access to one random spell they have prepared. The lost spell cannot be prepared again for 24 hours, leaving gaps in their magical repertoire.
