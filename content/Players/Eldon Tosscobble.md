# Notes
**Subclass: Phantom.** How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?
# Curse
**Bane of Lost Shadows**: The rogueâ€™s connection to the ethereal is severed. They lose the ability to fully merge with shadows, making their Stealth checks automatically fail once per day at a critical moment (at the DM's discretion).
